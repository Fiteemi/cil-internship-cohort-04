THE TCP/IP MODEL
TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/ Internet
Protocol. TCP/IP Stack is specifically designed as a model to
offer highly reliable and end-to-end byte stream over an
unreliable internet work.
The functionality of the TCP IP model is divided into four
layers, and each includes specific protocols.
TCP/IP is a layered server architecture system in which each
layer is defined according to a specific function to perform. All
these four TCP IP layers work collaboratively to transmit the
data from one layer to another.
 Application Layer
 Transport Layer
 Internet Layer
 Network Interface

Transport Layer- this layer permissions for devices to interact happens and this layer defines the amount of information that is transmitted
